# Customer Churn Prediction 🧠📉

This machine learning project predicts whether a telecom customer will churn using logistic regression and a tuned random forest model.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Goal: Predict customer churn based on demographic and account data
- Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest (tuned with GridSearchCV)
- Deployment: Streamlit UI

## 🚀 Tools & Tech
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab
- Streamlit
- GitHub

## 📊 Key Insights
- Random Forest achieved 84% accuracy
- Tenure, contract type, and monthly charges were top predictors
- ROC, confusion matrix, and feature importance visualized
